# vi-describe

## Introduction
This is a project created for TreeHacks 2023 by Ian Ng, Sean Mori, Ting Lin, Manh Dao and Cole Lee. Vi-Describe is a mobile app that crowdsources descriptions for images uploaded by visually impaired users. We especially focus on artwork and other visuals that visually impaired users might want diverse perspectives on.

##Technologies
Vi-Describe is built using React Native, with API calls to Supabase as our database solution. 

##Set up
